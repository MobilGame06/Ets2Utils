# Ets2Utils

Ets2Utils is a collection of utilities and enhancements for Euro Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2). It aims to improve the gameplay experience by providing various helpful features. Currently, the main feature available is the Anti-AFK feature, with more features planned for future releases.

## Features

### Anti-AFK

The Anti-AFK feature helps prevent being kicked from the game due to inactivity while playing ETS2. It automatically simulates player activity at regular intervals, ensuring that you stay connected even when you're away from the keyboard. This can be particularly useful when taking breaks or performing other tasks while the game is running.

More features will be added in future updates to enhance your ETS2 experience. Stay tuned!
